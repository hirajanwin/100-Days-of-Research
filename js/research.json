    "sum": "Yesterday the beloved Instagram revealed its new icon. The rebrand has evoked a lot of critique and discussion, which intrigued me to find out the mentality behind people's opinion on rebrands. Is it the fear of change, or the phenomenon of \"everyone is a designer\", or there is truly articulated design reasons to hate a seemingly fine rebrand? The digital world is noisy, the comments are flooding the Twittersphere. I often find myself in a storm of opinions and could not decide who I stand behind, or rather, where I hide. This research is a documentation of my struggle to navigate the rebrand critique world, and trying to make sense and grow as a graphic designer.",

Not because it’s good — it’s not, really — but because of its omnipresence in users’ phone screens. I bet it’s on the home screen of 99% of people who have the app and who tap it very regularly. When the iPhone first came out — if you’ll remember — skeuomorphism was the default aesthetic and now, for better or worse, it’s all about flat design with a dash of optional gradients so it’s no surprise that’s where Instagram has headed. If there was any surprise it’s that Instagram held on to the skeuomorphism for a relatively long five years."

I was so excited that I drafted an email immediately in the hotel to a type friend I met online (GitHub), who has experience building font serving open source project and also has an Asian background. But of course, this idea was not new, as \"Nothing is new under the sun\". I found out about justfont, which did exactly what I envisioned. A few months later I started to talk to Typekit about joining the team, and it turned out Typekit has the dynamic subsetting technology as well, ready to be launched in Japan. The technology is there, the real question now is why it is not as ground shattering as I imagined? Why is Chinese web design still not pushing as hard on typography as the West? Maybe it is the intrinsic beauty in the language character itself that shadowed the power of good typeface? Or eastern design has not evolved to the stage to be caring about such detail? I am leaning towards the former.",

Last year we announced the introduction of Source Han Sans, with glyph counts ranging from just under 18,000 for Japanese and nearly 31,000 for Simplified Chinese. Not only do they have a lot of glyphs, they have a lot of megabytes to go with them – from 4.2 to 8.8MB per font! How are you going to use those on your site?! Well, here’s what we have done: when you add an East Asian font family to your kit, it will automatically become what we call a dynamic kit. In a dynamic kit, you’ll have a new Character Set option in the kit editor called Dynamic Subsetting. When your dynamic kit JavaScript loads in the browser, it will detect your page’s character usage and request a dynamic subset for the glyphs needed for each member of the family. This makes for very small fonts, with incredibly fast load times."

Initially developed to reduce the larger file sizes of Chinese, Japanese and Korean fonts, dynamic subsetting automatically detects and delivers a Web font containing only the characters needed to render the page, thus dramatically reducing font file size. While Fonts.com Web Fonts has used dynamic subsetting for all of our East Asian fonts since its inception in 2010, we’d like to explore implementing the technology for other languages and use cases including mobile targeted content, dynamic branded content, social apps or rich media ads."

While there are no absolute rules to follow, it is crucial that you understand and apply some best practices when combining fonts in a design. When used with diligence and attention, these principles will always yield suitable results. Today we will take a close look at some the best practices for combining typefaces — as well as some blunders to avoid."

Nearly a century of colour theory development combined with perceptual testing has allowed us to better understand how individuals perceive and understand colour. From a semiotic perspective, colour works as a ‘sign vehicle’ when the map reader is able to understand that a specic colour on the map represents or stands for something in the real world and that multiple occurrences of that colour stand for the same kind of thing (MacEachren, 71995)."

It allows users to interpolate many intermediate \"instances\" of the typeface. The fonts have one or more \"axes\" which might typically represent the weight, width, or optical size of the font. Thus the user can generate a very large number of variations from a single font - thus providing unprecedented flexibility."

In other words, hinting is to fonts what responsive layout is to websites. It allows a single font file to adapt to a variety of contexts, the same way CSS allows a single HTML file to adapt to a variety of contexts."

After discovering the link between Vertical Rhythm and Repetition, we went on and figured out several ways we could replicate 24px to bring some variations to the design. Finally, after getting tired of repeating 24px vertically, we tried repeating 24px horizontally as well."

The METAFONTbook enables readers, with only minimal computer science or word processing experience, to master the basic as well as the more advanced features of METAFONT programming. With this manual, readers will learn how to write a program using METAFONT that can customize a type design that already exists, create an entire alphabet from scratch, and create logos or special symbols."

            "description": "In this collection, the second in the series, Knuth explores the relationship between computers and typography. The present volume, in the words of the author, is a legacy to all the work he has done on typography. When he thought he would take a few years' leave from his main work on the art of computer programming, as is well known, the short typographic detour lasted more than a decade. When type designers, punch cutters, typographers, book historians, and scholars visited the University during this period, it gave to Stanford what some consider to be its golden age of digital typography. By the author's own admission, the present work is one of the most difficult books that he has prepared. This is truly a work that only Knuth himself could have produced."
