I am fascinated by the Roden Crater, which was started in the 1960s and continue to evolve over the years as the artist's grand piece of work. 67 68 69 is focused exclusively on Turrell’s first light works and schematic drawings from the late 1960s, presumably 1967—1969 as the title suggests.",

Influenced by his Quaker faith, which he characterizes as having a “straightforward, strict presentation of the sublime,” Turrell’s art prompts greater self-awareness through a similar discipline of silent contemplation, patience, and meditation."

I feel that I want to use light as this wonderful and magic elixir that we drink as Vitamin D through the skin—and I mean, we are literally light-eaters—to then affect the way that we see. We live within this reality we create, and we’re quite unaware of how we create the reality. So the work is often a general koan into how we go about forming this world in which we live, in particular with seeing."

Representing the culmination of the artist’s lifelong research in the field of human visual and psychological perception, Roden Crater is a controlled environment for the experiencing and contemplation of light. It takes its place within the tradition of American landscape art that began in the 1960s, requiring a journey to visit the work in the remote desert with truly dark night skies. While minimally invasive to the external natural landscape, internally the red and black cinder has been transformed into special engineered spaces where the cycles of geologic and celestial time can be directly experienced. It will constitute a truly culminating phenomenon in world art."

Pursuing his vision at a great sacrifice, Turrell wryly comments \"People often ask me how much this crater costs.

Starting in their early teens, they studied stone carving under their father, mastering the craft before leaving home. The twins parted ways in 2003 to pursue their artistic goals individually. Simon studied painting at RISD while Nikolai toured as a musician. In 2007, the two reconvened in Los Angeles to tour with the band RRIICCEE, then founded The Haas Brothers there in 2010 when L.A. architects Johnston Marklee offered a chance to collaborate on a friend's project. Early on, the brothers received accolades for their exceptional craftsmanship and expansive studio practice. The years since have seen them evolve from fabricators and collaborators to nimble cross-pollinators in creative disciplines including fashion, film, music, art and design."

After the design of the Surveyor family of typefaces came to a close, an exploration was made into finding an approach where custom tools could be used to help prototype the kinds of highly intricate designs that may have been too complex to otherwise consider putting into development. This process led to the design of Obsidian, a typeface that is elaborately shaded in a style that makes reference to the same nineteenth century tradition of engraved lettering as Surveyor is rooted in. Andy Clymer, a senior designer at Hoefler & Co. and instructor in the Type@Cooper program, will share a look at the design process, the custom tools involved, and some of the unexpected challenges and discoveries found while designing Obsidian."

When the iPhone first came out — if you’ll remember — skeuomorphism was the default aesthetic and now, for better or worse, it’s all about flat design with a dash of optional gradients so it’s no surprise that’s where Instagram has headed. If there was any surprise it’s that Instagram held on to the skeuomorphism for a relatively long five years."

I was so excited that I drafted an email immediately in the hotel to a type friend I met online (GitHub), who has experience building font serving open source project and also has an Asian background. But of course, this idea was not new, as \"Nothing is new under the sun\". I found out about justfont, which did exactly what I envisioned. A few months later I started to talk to Typekit about joining the team, and it turned out Typekit has the dynamic subsetting technology as well, ready to be launched in Japan. The technology is there, the real question now is why it is not as ground shattering as I imagined? Why is Chinese web design still not pushing as hard on typography as the West? Maybe it is the intrinsic beauty in the language character itself that shadowed the power of good typeface? Or eastern design has not evolved to the stage to be caring about such detail? I am leaning towards the former.",

Last year we announced the introduction of Source Han Sans, with glyph counts ranging from just under 18,000 for Japanese and nearly 31,000 for Simplified Chinese. Not only do they have a lot of glyphs, they have a lot of megabytes to go with them – from 4.2 to 8.8MB per font! How are you going to use those on your site?! Well, here’s what we have done: when you add an East Asian font family to your kit, it will automatically become what we call a dynamic kit. In a dynamic kit, you’ll have a new Character Set option in the kit editor called Dynamic Subsetting. When your dynamic kit JavaScript loads in the browser, it will detect your page’s character usage and request a dynamic subset for the glyphs needed for each member of the family. This makes for very small fonts, with incredibly fast load times."

Initially developed to reduce the larger file sizes of Chinese, Japanese and Korean fonts, dynamic subsetting automatically detects and delivers a Web font containing only the characters needed to render the page, thus dramatically reducing font file size. While Fonts.com Web Fonts has used dynamic subsetting for all of our East Asian fonts since its inception in 2010, we’d like to explore implementing the technology for other languages and use cases including mobile targeted content, dynamic branded content, social apps or rich media ads."

From a semiotic perspective, colour works as a ‘sign vehicle’ when the map reader is able to understand that a specic colour on the map represents or stands for something in the real world and that multiple occurrences of that colour stand for the same kind of thing (MacEachren, 71995)."

In other words, hinting is to fonts what responsive layout is to websites. It allows a single font file to adapt to a variety of contexts, the same way CSS allows a single HTML file to adapt to a variety of contexts."

After discovering the link between Vertical Rhythm and Repetition, we went on and figured out several ways we could replicate 24px to bring some variations to the design. Finally, after getting tired of repeating 24px vertically, we tried repeating 24px horizontally as well."

The solution I finally came up with turned out to involve some interesting mathematics, and I believe that students of calculus and analytic geometry may enjoy looking into the question as I did.

When type designers, punch cutters, typographers, book historians, and scholars visited the University during this period, it gave to Stanford what some consider to be its golden age of digital typography.
