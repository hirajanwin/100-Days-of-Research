    "sum": "Taking a tour at woodside press during Typographics conference, I got the chance to witness how linotype machine works in person. In awe of how the technology works, I set out to find out how printing technology evolves. The other new fact I learned after the letterpress tour, is that even though China invented the first movable type technology, the modern printing technology was actually imported from Japan back to China. It is kind of irony but fact is fact. Always be humble and learn, and never stop innovation. Innovation like printing technology really changed the world and people’s lives forever.",

The earliest examples include Cylinder seals and other objects such as the Cyrus Cylinder and the Cylinders of Nabonidus. The earliest known form of woodblock printing came from China dating to before 220 A.D. Later developments in printing include the movable type, first developed by Bi Sheng in China. Johannes Gutenberg introduced mechanical movable type printing to Europe in the 15th century. His printing press played a key role in the development of the Renaissance, Reformation, the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific revolution and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses."

Along with letterpress printing, linotype was the industry standard for newspapers, magazines and posters from the late 19th century to the 1960s and 70s, when it was largely replaced by offset lithography printing and computer typesetting. The name of the machine comes from the fact that it produces an entire line of metal type at once, hence a line-o'-type, a significant improvement over the previous industry standard, i.e., manual, letter-by-letter typesetting using a composing stick and drawers of letters."

It is divided into two machines, the Monotype keyboard and the Monotype caster, which communicate by perforated paper tape. It is not necessary to have the same number of each machine. 2. The Monotype caster casts individual letters, which are assembled into lines in a fashion similar to classical movable type. This requires a more complex high-speed water-cooled casting mold, but only requires one matrix per possible character."

The use of round seals for rolling an impression into clay tablets goes back to early Mesopotamian civilization before 3000 BCE, where they are the most common works of art to survive, and feature complex and beautiful images. In both China and Egypt, the use of small stamps for seals preceded the use of larger blocks. In China, India and Europe, the printing of cloth certainly preceded the printing of paper or papyrus. The process is essentially the same - in Europe special presentation impressions of prints were often printed on silk until the seventeenth century. The development of printing has made it possible for books, newspapers, magazines, and other reading materials to be produced in great numbers, and it plays an important role in promoting literacy among the masses."

When used in combination with the lithographic process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains ink from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a water-based film (called “fountain solution”), keeping the non-printing areas ink-free. The modern “web” process feeds a large reel of paper through a large press machine in several parts, typically for several metres, which then prints continuously as the paper is fed through."

A blade or squeegee is moved across the screen to fill the open mesh apertures with ink, and a reverse stroke then causes the screen to touch the substrate momentarily along a line of contact. This causes the ink to wet the substrate and be pulled out of the mesh apertures as the screen springs back after the blade has passed."

These pioneering graphic artists saw design as part of industrial production and searched for anonymous, objective visual communication. They chose photographic images rather than illustration, and typefaces that were industrial-looking rather than those designed for books."

Eskilson demonstrates how a new era began for design arts under the influence of Victorian reformers, tracing the emergence of modernist design styles in the early 20th century, and examining the wartime politicization of regional styles. Richly contextualized chapters chronicle the history of the Bauhaus and the rise of the International Style in the 1950s and '60s, and the postmodern movement of the 1970s and '80s. The book's final chapter looks at current trends in graphic design, with in-depth discussions of grunge, comic book, and graffiti aesthetics; historicism and appropriation; and the influence of technology, web design, and motion graphics."

Anxieties about industrial life fueled a positive revaluation of handcraftsmanship and precapitalist forms of culture and society. Arts and Crafts designers sought to improve standards of decorative design, believed to have been debased by mechanization, and to create environments in which beautiful and fine workmanship governed. The Arts and Crafts movement did not promote a particular style, but it did advocate reform as part of its philosophy and instigated a critique of industrial labor; as modern machines replaced workers, Arts and Crafts proponents called for an end to the division of labor and advanced the designer as craftsman."

Second, he was a pioneer of unjustified, ranged-left setting for text. Third, he had extended ‘functional’ into ‘integral’ typography, where the message and its form are inseparable and interdependent – idea, text and typographical presentation are one. The book presents the five decades of his working life, with an introduction to each section (text on white pages) and a commentary on each job (reproduced in white panels on warm grey). Each decade is preceded by an essay on art and design, on visual language, on logos and labels, on the job of the art director, and ‘Good Design: What Is It?’"

Instead, he counsels us to really see type and then adjust the letterforms so they are balanced and beautiful. Along the way, he touches on points small and large: indents, sizing, spacing, line length, punctuation, and the main differences between setting text for screen versus print."

Unlike print, there is a lot of user-generated content that you won't be able to typeset in character level, such as changing the dummy quote to smart quote, or hanging the quote outside, or adding hair space before and after en dash. All these fine details that were honored in print design is lost in the web. I am researching if I can bring them back through the power of javascript.

Created especially for this exhibition, the installation The Colonies (2016) was made by hand, using inexpensive construction materials and techniques. Within this environment, Beloufa deliberately obstructs and refracts images, diffusing them onto multiple surfaces. By revealing the cables and cords in his works and looping in images of viewers through closed-circuit television, the artist makes technology visible and incorporates the spectator as an individual participant in and producer of surveillance culture."

The resulting works, which mix the seemingly incommensurate languages of Minimalism and Pop, are powerful both as three-dimensional structures and as assemblages of two-dimensional imagery."

            "description": "A towering figure in 19th-century art, Degas is best known as a painter and chronicler of the ballet. Yet his work in monotype reveals the true extent of his restless experimentation. In the mid-1870s, Degas was introduced to the monotype process, a technique in which the artist draws in ink on a metal plate that is then run through a press, typically resulting in a single print. Degas embraced the medium with enormous enthusiasm, inventing a new repertoire of mark-making that included wiping, scraping, scratching, fingerprinting and rendering via removal. The resulting works are characterized by enigmatic and mutable forms, luminous passages emerging from darkness and a heightened tactility. Taking the monotype process to radical ends, Degas explored a variety of subjects, including city dwellers in motion; harshly illuminated cafe singers, ballet dancers on and offstage, women in intimate settings; and evanescent landscapes. With this medium, Degas is at his most modern, liberating drawing from tradition, depicting the body in new and daring ways, and boldly engaging the possibilities of abstraction."

This is transmedia typography, type that can be expressed in a variety of visual environments, including screen-based, print-based, and emerging media. This course adapts Brad Bartlett's acclaimed transmedia typography class taught at Art Center College of Design and introduces mediatecture (aka media architecture), a ground-breaking course developed by Nik Hafermaas. Bartlett and Hafermaas explore the new ecosystems that typography now resides in and the tools (such as sensors and projectors) that designers can use to develop their own transmedia typography projects. Topics include: Developing dynamic identities; Exploring data-driven and generative logotypes; Spatializing letterforms with scale and dimension; Applying transmedia typography across analog and digital media; Exploring typography in emerging and augmented environments; Developing typography for scenography and mediatecture; Working with transmedia tools and video storytelling; Exploring commercial applications such as mediatecture."

He walks through choosing the right typeface and styling type—without using the automatic settings on which many designers rely. Instead, he counsels us to really see type and then adjust the letterforms so they are balanced and beautiful. Along the way, he touches on points small and large: indents, sizing, spacing, line length, punctuation, and the main differences between setting text for screen versus print."

In this course, Jill Butler distills her many years of teaching and design consulting into 33 laws of typography. These laws are the details that designers can overlook or, in some cases, never learned, but that make for stronger compositions. Here these rules are broken down into five categories: documents, large bodies of text, small blocks of text, punctuation, and typefaces. Dive into any section to start learning how to put these principles into action in your own designs."

The in-house team redrew the typeface in partnership with typographer Ben Kiel of type foundry House Industries. … Designer Massimo Vignelli was responsible for the last redesign 13 years ago, introducing similarly light touches like a more structured grid to the layout and the addition of red type to the front-of-book sections."

            "description": "His fascination with the phenomena of light is ultimately connected to a very personal, inward search for mankind’s place in the universe. Influenced by his Quaker faith, which he characterizes as having a “straightforward, strict presentation of the sublime,” Turrell’s art prompts greater self-awareness through a similar discipline of silent contemplation, patience, and meditation."

I feel that I want to use light as this wonderful and magic elixir that we drink as Vitamin D through the skin—and I mean, we are literally light-eaters—to then affect the way that we see. We live within this reality we create, and we’re quite unaware of how we create the reality. So the work is often a general koan into how we go about forming this world in which we live, in particular with seeing."

Representing the culmination of the artist’s lifelong research in the field of human visual and psychological perception, Roden Crater is a controlled environment for the experiencing and contemplation of light. It takes its place within the tradition of American landscape art that began in the 1960s, requiring a journey to visit the work in the remote desert with truly dark night skies. While minimally invasive to the external natural landscape, internally the red and black cinder has been transformed into special engineered spaces where the cycles of geologic and celestial time can be directly experienced. It will constitute a truly culminating phenomenon in world art."

Pursuing his vision at a great sacrifice, Turrell wryly comments \"People often ask me how much this crater costs.

Starting in their early teens, they studied stone carving under their father, mastering the craft before leaving home. The twins parted ways in 2003 to pursue their artistic goals individually. Simon studied painting at RISD while Nikolai toured as a musician. In 2007, the two reconvened in Los Angeles to tour with the band RRIICCEE, then founded The Haas Brothers there in 2010 when L.A. architects Johnston Marklee offered a chance to collaborate on a friend's project. Early on, the brothers received accolades for their exceptional craftsmanship and expansive studio practice. The years since have seen them evolve from fabricators and collaborators to nimble cross-pollinators in creative disciplines including fashion, film, music, art and design."

After the design of the Surveyor family of typefaces came to a close, an exploration was made into finding an approach where custom tools could be used to help prototype the kinds of highly intricate designs that may have been too complex to otherwise consider putting into development. This process led to the design of Obsidian, a typeface that is elaborately shaded in a style that makes reference to the same nineteenth century tradition of engraved lettering as Surveyor is rooted in. Andy Clymer, a senior designer at Hoefler & Co. and instructor in the Type@Cooper program, will share a look at the design process, the custom tools involved, and some of the unexpected challenges and discoveries found while designing Obsidian."

Not because it’s good — it’s not, really — but because of its omnipresence in users’ phone screens. I bet it’s on the home screen of 99% of people who have the app and who tap it very regularly. When the iPhone first came out — if you’ll remember — skeuomorphism was the default aesthetic and now, for better or worse, it’s all about flat design with a dash of optional gradients so it’s no surprise that’s where Instagram has headed. If there was any surprise it’s that Instagram held on to the skeuomorphism for a relatively long five years."

I was so excited that I drafted an email immediately in the hotel to a type friend I met online (GitHub), who has experience building font serving open source project and also has an Asian background. But of course, this idea was not new, as \"Nothing is new under the sun\". I found out about justfont, which did exactly what I envisioned. A few months later I started to talk to Typekit about joining the team, and it turned out Typekit has the dynamic subsetting technology as well, ready to be launched in Japan. The technology is there, the real question now is why it is not as ground shattering as I imagined? Why is Chinese web design still not pushing as hard on typography as the West? Maybe it is the intrinsic beauty in the language character itself that shadowed the power of good typeface? Or eastern design has not evolved to the stage to be caring about such detail? I am leaning towards the former.",

Last year we announced the introduction of Source Han Sans, with glyph counts ranging from just under 18,000 for Japanese and nearly 31,000 for Simplified Chinese. Not only do they have a lot of glyphs, they have a lot of megabytes to go with them – from 4.2 to 8.8MB per font! How are you going to use those on your site?! Well, here’s what we have done: when you add an East Asian font family to your kit, it will automatically become what we call a dynamic kit. In a dynamic kit, you’ll have a new Character Set option in the kit editor called Dynamic Subsetting. When your dynamic kit JavaScript loads in the browser, it will detect your page’s character usage and request a dynamic subset for the glyphs needed for each member of the family. This makes for very small fonts, with incredibly fast load times."

While Fonts.com Web Fonts has used dynamic subsetting for all of our East Asian fonts since its inception in 2010, we’d like to explore implementing the technology for other languages and use cases including mobile targeted content, dynamic branded content, social apps or rich media ads."

These dimensions are three of the visual variables or basic ‘building blocks’ of graphics (Bertin, 1983). Nearly a century of colour theory development combined with perceptual testing has allowed us to better understand how individuals perceive and understand colour. From a semiotic perspective, colour works as a ‘sign vehicle’ when the map reader is able to understand that a specific colour on the map represents or stands for something in the real world and that multiple occurrences of that colour stand for the same kind of thing (MacEachren, 71995)."

At one dinner with coworkers, because of my lacking in experience with babies and child education and ability to hold such conversation, I started a random new topic about variable fonts with another quiet dinner-goer. A few minutes later I started to get excited because I heard some exciting development on this subject, which was happening as we spoke. I love my job.",

At the moment it’s horrendously limiting, and I think this has the effect of blinding us… I believe that these weaknesses in the programming—in the technical limitations of css and within the font formats themselves—have slowly become a weakness in aesthetics."

Stanford professor Donald Knuth begins with his article, “The Concept of a MetaFont” (Winter 1981). Two years prior, Knuth had conceived and programmed METAFONT — a software that enabled users to generate unlimited numbers of fonts by controlling a limited set of parameters. The article is a performative account of his intervening attempts, using METAFONT to harness the essential “intelligence” of letterforms."

The other letter was 'S'. For three days and nights I had a terrible time trying to understand how a proper 'S' could really be defined. The solution I finally came up with turned out to involve some interesting mathematics, and I believe that students of calculus and analytic geometry may enjoy looking into the question as I did. The purpose of this paper is to explain what I now consider to be the 'right' mathematics underlying printed S's, and also to give an example of the METAFONT language I have recently been developing."

The present volume, in the words of the author, is a legacy to all the work he has done on typography. When he thought he would take a few years' leave from his main work on the art of computer programming, as is well known, the short typographic detour lasted more than a decade. When type designers, punch cutters, typographers, book historians, and scholars visited the University during this period, it gave to Stanford what some consider to be its golden age of digital typography. By the author's own admission, the present work is one of the most difficult books that he has prepared. This is truly a work that only Knuth himself could have produced."
