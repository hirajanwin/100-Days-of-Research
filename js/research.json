Created especially for this exhibition, the installation The Colonies (2016) was made by hand, using inexpensive construction materials and techniques. Within this environment, Beloufa deliberately obstructs and refracts images, diffusing them onto multiple surfaces. By revealing the cables and cords in his works and looping in images of viewers through closed-circuit television, the artist makes technology visible and incorporates the spectator as an individual participant in and producer of surveillance culture."

The resulting works, which mix the seemingly incommensurate languages of Minimalism and Pop, are powerful both as three-dimensional structures and as assemblages of two-dimensional imagery."

            "description": "A towering figure in 19th-century art, Degas is best known as a painter and chronicler of the ballet. Yet his work in monotype reveals the true extent of his restless experimentation. In the mid-1870s, Degas was introduced to the monotype process, a technique in which the artist draws in ink on a metal plate that is then run through a press, typically resulting in a single print. Degas embraced the medium with enormous enthusiasm, inventing a new repertoire of mark-making that included wiping, scraping, scratching, fingerprinting and rendering via removal. The resulting works are characterized by enigmatic and mutable forms, luminous passages emerging from darkness and a heightened tactility. Taking the monotype process to radical ends, Degas explored a variety of subjects, including city dwellers in motion; harshly illuminated cafe singers, ballet dancers on and offstage, women in intimate settings; and evanescent landscapes. With this medium, Degas is at his most modern, liberating drawing from tradition, depicting the body in new and daring ways, and boldly engaging the possibilities of abstraction."

Bartlett and Hafermaas explore the new ecosystems that typography now resides in and the tools (such as sensors and projectors) that designers can use to develop their own transmedia typography projects. Topics include: Developing dynamic identities; Exploring data-driven and generative logotypes; Spatializing letterforms with scale and dimension; Applying transmedia typography across analog and digital media; Exploring typography in emerging and augmented environments; Developing typography for scenography and mediatecture; Working with transmedia tools and video storytelling; Exploring commercial applications such as mediatecture."

            "description": "Typography, done right, can enrich any message, making it beautiful and easy to understand. In this course, Jill Butler distills her many years of teaching and design consulting into 33 laws of typography. These laws are the details that designers can overlook or, in some cases, never learned, but that make for stronger compositions. Here these rules are broken down into five categories: documents, large bodies of text, small blocks of text, punctuation, and typefaces. Dive into any section to start learning how to put these principles into action in your own designs."

The in-house team redrew the typeface in partnership with typographer Ben Kiel of type foundry House Industries. … Designer Massimo Vignelli was responsible for the last redesign 13 years ago, introducing similarly light touches like a more structured grid to the layout and the addition of red type to the front-of-book sections."

I feel that I want to use light as this wonderful and magic elixir that we drink as Vitamin D through the skin—and I mean, we are literally light-eaters—to then affect the way that we see. We live within this reality we create, and we’re quite unaware of how we create the reality. So the work is often a general koan into how we go about forming this world in which we live, in particular with seeing."

Representing the culmination of the artist’s lifelong research in the field of human visual and psychological perception, Roden Crater is a controlled environment for the experiencing and contemplation of light. It takes its place within the tradition of American landscape art that began in the 1960s, requiring a journey to visit the work in the remote desert with truly dark night skies. While minimally invasive to the external natural landscape, internally the red and black cinder has been transformed into special engineered spaces where the cycles of geologic and celestial time can be directly experienced. It will constitute a truly culminating phenomenon in world art."

Pursuing his vision at a great sacrifice, Turrell wryly comments \"People often ask me how much this crater costs. It cost me two marriages and a relationship.\" This segment focuses on two new works in Houston, Texas—an underground tunnel of light and a skyspace in the ceiling of a Friends meetinghouse—in addition to Turrell's life's work in Arizona's remote Painted Desert—the \"Roden Crater.\""

Starting in their early teens, they studied stone carving under their father, mastering the craft before leaving home. The twins parted ways in 2003 to pursue their artistic goals individually. Simon studied painting at RISD while Nikolai toured as a musician. In 2007, the two reconvened in Los Angeles to tour with the band RRIICCEE, then founded The Haas Brothers there in 2010 when L.A. architects Johnston Marklee offered a chance to collaborate on a friend's project. Early on, the brothers received accolades for their exceptional craftsmanship and expansive studio practice. The years since have seen them evolve from fabricators and collaborators to nimble cross-pollinators in creative disciplines including fashion, film, music, art and design."

Our goal is to enhance the relation between natural and man-made environments by achieving high degrees of design customization and versatility, environmental performance integration, and material efficiency.

I wished to find a third topic that is equally interesting but failed. Both of these two topics are so unique and rare, they involve beautiful math, which is always my favorite, and at the same time, the application of the math is so natively graphical, therefore naturally good for making generative art. As a result of doing this research, I bought one of the books I posted here — this project is getting expensive!",

After the design of the Surveyor family of typefaces came to a close, an exploration was made into finding an approach where custom tools could be used to help prototype the kinds of highly intricate designs that may have been too complex to otherwise consider putting into development. This process led to the design of Obsidian, a typeface that is elaborately shaded in a style that makes reference to the same nineteenth century tradition of engraved lettering as Surveyor is rooted in. Andy Clymer, a senior designer at Hoefler & Co. and instructor in the Type@Cooper program, will share a look at the design process, the custom tools involved, and some of the unexpected challenges and discoveries found while designing Obsidian."

The whole ensemble looks like a red double-decker bus that has stopped short, shoving the passengers into each other’s backs. Worse, the entire top half of the new logo consists of the word the."

I was so excited that I drafted an email immediately in the hotel to a type friend I met online (GitHub), who has experience building font serving open source project and also has an Asian background. But of course, this idea was not new, as \"Nothing is new under the sun\". I found out about justfont, which did exactly what I envisioned. A few months later I started to talk to Typekit about joining the team, and it turned out Typekit has the dynamic subsetting technology as well, ready to be launched in Japan. The technology is there, the real question now is why it is not as ground shattering as I imagined? Why is Chinese web design still not pushing as hard on typography as the West? Maybe it is the intrinsic beauty in the language character itself that shadowed the power of good typeface? Or eastern design has not evolved to the stage to be caring about such detail? I am leaning towards the former.",

Last year we announced the introduction of Source Han Sans, with glyph counts ranging from just under 18,000 for Japanese and nearly 31,000 for Simplified Chinese. Not only do they have a lot of glyphs, they have a lot of megabytes to go with them – from 4.2 to 8.8MB per font! How are you going to use those on your site?! Well, here’s what we have done: when you add an East Asian font family to your kit, it will automatically become what we call a dynamic kit. In a dynamic kit, you’ll have a new Character Set option in the kit editor called Dynamic Subsetting. When your dynamic kit JavaScript loads in the browser, it will detect your page’s character usage and request a dynamic subset for the glyphs needed for each member of the family. This makes for very small fonts, with incredibly fast load times."

Initially developed to reduce the larger file sizes of Chinese, Japanese and Korean fonts, dynamic subsetting automatically detects and delivers a Web font containing only the characters needed to render the page, thus dramatically reducing font file size. While Fonts.com Web Fonts has used dynamic subsetting for all of our East Asian fonts since its inception in 2010, we’d like to explore implementing the technology for other languages and use cases including mobile targeted content, dynamic branded content, social apps or rich media ads."

These dimensions are three of the visual variables or basic ‘building blocks’ of graphics (Bertin, 1983). Nearly a century of colour theory development combined with perceptual testing has allowed us to better understand how individuals perceive and understand colour. From a semiotic perspective, colour works as a ‘sign vehicle’ when the map reader is able to understand that a specific colour on the map represents or stands for something in the real world and that multiple occurrences of that colour stand for the same kind of thing (MacEachren, 71995)."

Finally, after getting tired of repeating 24px vertically, we tried repeating 24px horizontally as well."

The solution I finally came up with turned out to involve some interesting mathematics, and I believe that students of calculus and analytic geometry may enjoy looking into the question as I did. The purpose of this paper is to explain what I now consider to be the 'right' mathematics underlying printed S's, and also to give an example of the METAFONT language I have recently been developing."

It was created by Donald Knuth with his Metafont program, and was most recently updated in 1992. Computer Modern, or variants of it, remains very widely used in scientific publishing, especially in disciplines that make frequent use of mathematical notation."

The construction of a typeface is an art form and this manual is written for people who wish to advance the quality of mathematical typesetting. The METAFONTbook enables readers, with only minimal computer science or word processing experience, to master the basic as well as the more advanced features of METAFONT programming. With this manual, readers will learn how to write a program using METAFONT that can customize a type design that already exists, create an entire alphabet from scratch, and create logos or special symbols."

            "description": "In this collection, the second in the series, Knuth explores the relationship between computers and typography. The present volume, in the words of the author, is a legacy to all the work he has done on typography. When he thought he would take a few years' leave from his main work on the art of computer programming, as is well known, the short typographic detour lasted more than a decade. When type designers, punch cutters, typographers, book historians, and scholars visited the University during this period, it gave to Stanford what some consider to be its golden age of digital typography. By the author's own admission, the present work is one of the most difficult books that he has prepared. This is truly a work that only Knuth himself could have produced."
