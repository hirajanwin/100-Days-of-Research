The one I agree the most is “The New Web Typography”. For the past few years, Web Typography is playing catch up, trying to achieve what has been done on the print. Web is a new medium, very different than print, and it is facing a lot of new challenges. Instead of doing everything “by the book”, new rules should be defined, and old rules that doesn’t apply any more should be tossed. Treat Web Typography as its own unique art form and medium.",

I realized that the biggest argument Tom was making in the article was that web typography is broken because type doesn’t sit perfectly on a baseline grid… I knew the importance of Vertical Rhythm and the baseline grid. I also knew that details matter when it comes to design. But is this one detail enough to break web typography?"

Repetition has the ability to make things feel that they belong together. It gives the feeling that someone has thought it all out, like it’s part of the plan. After discovering the link between Vertical Rhythm and Repetition, we went on and figured out several ways we could replicate 24px to bring some variations to the design. Finally, after getting tired of repeating 24px vertically, we tried repeating 24px horizontally as well."

The solution I finally came up with turned out to involve some interesting mathematics, and I believe that students of calculus and analytic geometry may enjoy looking into the question as I did. The purpose of this paper is to explain what I now consider to be the 'right' mathematics underlying printed S's, and also to give an example of the METAFONT language I have recently been developing."

When type designers, punch cutters, typographers, book historians, and scholars visited the University during this period, it gave to Stanford what some consider to be its golden age of digital typography.
